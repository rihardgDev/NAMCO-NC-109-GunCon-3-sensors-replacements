NAMCO NC-109 GunCon 3 sensors replacements

The IR emitters are often lost, but making replacements is not very complicated. 

BOM:  
6x 850nm IR LED emitters connected in paralel  (Voltage Drop Across LED is 1.7V)  
2x 20ohm resistors  
power source, i used 3V batteries, but might switch to USB if I'll use this thing a lot.
